GRAphite Integrate Development Environment.

To run from source you will need:

grcompiler
graphite2 (v1.1.3 or later)
python
pyside
qt4

For those wanting to add images to the lib/graide/images directory. Make sure you
update the pyresources.qrc and run:

pyside-rcc -o pyresources.py pyresources.qrc

so that you can see the images from the program.
